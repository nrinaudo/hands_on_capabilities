# Capabilities explorations

This repository is intended to store the code I write while toying with capabilities and related features.

Current modules:
- `capture`: exploration of capture checking.
- `numbers`: the numbers guessing game used in [my introduction to capabilities](https://nrinaudo.github.io/articles/capabilities.html).
